# FMCW mmWave
ROS 2 Package (C++) for TI IWR1443BOOST and TI DCA1000EVM FMCW mmWave Radar System

This project is based off of the work done for the RaDICaL SDK: 
https://moodoki.github.io/radical_sdk/
https://publish.illinois.edu/radicaldata/

## Getting started
This repository includes the ROS 2 package written in C++ with real time visualization scripts written in Python. There is also an example script for working with prerecorded data in the .db3 format, which is the format for ROS 2 bags.

I recommend reading the ROS 2 documentation to set up your ROS 2 environment and workspace, then adding the package to the workspace within the src folder.
